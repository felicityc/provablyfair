hmac verifiers for bitsler

this is a small collection of in progress verifiers which check your bets on (at the moment, just bitsler). I wanted to make them myself (ok with a little help) so that I knew I could trust everything that was going into it and understand how it works and what to look for. 

on top of that, having my own verifiers also lets me generate mountains of sample data, since bet results are based on these formulas, you can make an infinite amount of fake ones that could be real if the components were the same. 

note: the crash python script i have currently actually goes to bitsler and pulls the real scores from each 'round' as shown on the website itself, which i can then use in my excel sheet. currently the dice analysis sheet is the most complete, but they are all pretty schizo anyway. 

While these sheets are written for bitsler, as long as the game has a similar output in terms of result, any site can be analyzed. Crash/blast in particular is very universal. You can compare trends and the different house edges. Some places hit more 1000xs and some dont. 

the blast/crash sheet is the same for boom/limbo, they are essentially the same game. 

the plinko excel sheet i only just started working on. i tried a couple sample sets of 20,000 rolls and it is so abysmally bad it makes the other games look like the salvation army. so I might just not bother but I will try a little more to see if there is anything at all redeemable. 

I may try to put some of these analysis sheets on a website and modernize provably fair a bit because all the calculators online are super old. It was fun
